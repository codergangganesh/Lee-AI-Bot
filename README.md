  <em>Your personal voice-enabled virtual assistant</em>
</p>

An interactive voice-enabled virtual assistant built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that responds to voice commands and provides spoken feedback.


## 🎯 Project Overview

Lee Chong Wei is a virtual assistant that leverages the Web Speech API to provide hands-free interaction. Users can speak commands to the assistant, which will respond verbally and perform various tasks like opening websites, telling time, and searching the web.

This project demonstrates the power of web-based voice technologies and provides an accessible interface for users who prefer voice interaction over traditional input methods.

### Key Benefits

- **Hands-Free Operation**: Control your computer without touching the keyboard or mouse
- **Accessibility**: Useful for users with mobility or vision impairments
- **Convenience**: Quick access to information and applications
- **Learning Tool**: Demonstrates modern web APIs in action

## ✨ Features

- **🎤 Voice Recognition**: Uses the Web Speech API to listen and interpret user commands
- **🔊 Voice Synthesis**: Provides spoken responses using text-to-speech capabilities
- **⏰ Time & Date**: Tells current time and date on request
- **🌐 Website Launcher**: Opens popular websites (YouTube, Google, Facebook, Instagram)
- **⚙️ Application Opener**: Launches system applications (Calculator, WhatsApp, Gmail)
- **🔍 Web Search**: Searches Google for queries not directly recognized
- **👋 Contextual Greetings**: Greets users differently based on time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome recommended for best Web Speech API support)
- Internet connection for CDN resources and web searches
- Microphone access (browser will prompt for permission)

### Quick Start

├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── style.css           # Styling and animations
├── script.js           # Core functionality and logic

├── voice.gif           # Animated voice indicator
└── mic.svg             # Microphone icon
```

### Key Components

- **index.html**: The main interface with the assistant's visual elements
- **style.css**: Responsive design with gradient buttons and animations
- **script.js**: Implements the Web Speech API and command processing logic

## 💻 Browser Compatibility

The Web Speech API has varying support across different browsers:

| Browser | Speech Recognition | Speech Synthesis |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Chrome  | ✅ Supported       | ✅ Supported      |
| Firefox | ⚠️ Partial         | ✅ Supported      |
| Safari  | ❌ Not Supported   | ✅ Supported      |
| Edge    | ✅ Supported       | ✅ Supported      |

> **Note**: For the best experience, use Google Chrome as it has the most comprehensive support for the Web Speech API.

### Mobile Compatibility

- **Android**: Chrome Mobile fully supports both speech recognition and synthesis
- **iOS**: Safari on iOS has limited support; Chrome recommended

### Design Features

- Dark theme interface for reduced eye strain
- Gradient button with hover effects
- Animated voice indicator during speech recognition
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: On page load, the assistant greets the user based on the time of day
2. **Voice Input**: Clicking the button activates the microphone for voice input
3. **Command Processing**: The assistant analyzes the spoken command
4. **Action Execution**: Based on the command, it performs the appropriate action
5. **Verbal Response**: The assistant provides spoken feedback to the user

### Technical Flow

The application uses two main components of the Web Speech API:
- **SpeechRecognition**: Converts spoken words into text
- **SpeechSynthesis**: Converts text into spoken words

When a command is received, the system:
1. Normalizes the input text to lowercase
2. Matches against predefined command patterns
3. Executes the corresponding action
4. Generates a verbal response using text-to-speech
